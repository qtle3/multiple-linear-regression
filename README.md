# Multiple Linear Regression for Startup Profit Prediction

This project demonstrates the use of multiple linear regression to predict the profit of startups based on their spending in R&D, Administration, Marketing, and the state where the startup operates. The script processes the dataset, encodes categorical data, and trains a linear regression model to predict profit based on these independent variables.
